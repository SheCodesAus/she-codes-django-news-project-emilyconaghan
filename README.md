Hi! Welcome to my completed Django project.

## Features

In this project, I completed the following features:

* The ability to create news stories through a form
* Ordering of the news stories by date added
* Styling of the news site, including the form
* The ability for users to add an Image URL that is automatically added to the news story
* A user app with functionality 
* A functioning login/logout button
* The ability for users to see their account information
* A function where users can sign up so they can add new stories
* The ability for users to view stories created by a particular author
* Functionality for information to be hidden based of whether a user is logged in or out
* Functionality for creating a new story page to be disabled if a user is logged out

## Next Steps

I see this submission as the first iteration of this project. To improve upon this project, I'd like to look at implementing and improving the following features: 
* Further styling in CSS (including rollover functions)
* A dropdown box to filter by author 
* Solving how to have accurate time within the DateTime model
* Author Bio page where authors can add in a bio while signing up
